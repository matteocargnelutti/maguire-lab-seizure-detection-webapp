## About this folder
This folder contains the source for the frontend of the application.

After edits are made, `build.py` will need to be run to update `static/bundle.css` and `static/bundle.js` with the latest changes.

Alternatively, if running the app locally in development mode, simply refreshing the app in the browser will generate a new set of bundle files.
