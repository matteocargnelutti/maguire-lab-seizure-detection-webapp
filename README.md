## About
This web app uses deep learning to detect seizure activity from single-channel LFP/EEG brain recordings.

## How does it work
- Provide the app with a CSV file containing rodent EEG data, where each row is a sequence of 500 samples at 100 Hz.

- The app will read the file and send it by chunks to our server, where our machine learning algorithm runs. Nothing is stored on our end.

- Once the whole file has been processed, the app generates a dynamic visualization allowing verification, editing and export of the results.
